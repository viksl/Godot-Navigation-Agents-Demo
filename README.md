### Instructions
Run the tech demo, click on the Instructions button at the very top.

If you try the Obstacle map then use low numbers of agents and work your way up. The demo isn't optimized for obstacles at all for now.
In the past I made a nav test with 500k - 1mil obstacles on a map and made it work with a decent number of agents, so it's definitely
possible to optimize the obstacle movement more.
I included it since some people arlready asked me about obstacles in my previous progress update so I wanted to give you an option to try it too.
