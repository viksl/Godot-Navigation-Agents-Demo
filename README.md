### Info
This project was is part of a swarm like prototype in Godot Engine (4.5+).
It utilizes built-in functionality rather than a completely custom solution.
Navigation is done through the built-in navigation with navigation agents.
Rendering is handled with a multimesh instance.
This is not a general-purpose navigation demo.
Many more optimizations can be done.
Use it as a point of study if you want, I highly recommend you to use the navigation documentation:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/tutorials/navigation/index.html since it's very informative and well written.
It will give you a better understanding of how the navigation works, rather than my makeshift use of it.
Obstacle map can use a lot of improvements too, but I can already run 15k agents with 600+ fps on it,
so right now it's not a priority.

### Instructions
You can run an exported build on itch.io (link above).
Click on the Instructions button in the project to see the instructions.
Tweaking settings in code/exported values is recommended to get the best results.
